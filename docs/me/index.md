## About ME

I'm a software engineer who’s truly passionate about what I do. Over the past couple of years, I’ve gained solid experience working with Golang, Docker, and Kubernetes, and I love solving problems, whether they're big or small. I'm always eager to learn something new and enjoy adapting to different technologies—it keeps things exciting and fresh! What drives me most is the challenge of building and improving systems, knowing that there's always room to grow and innovate.
